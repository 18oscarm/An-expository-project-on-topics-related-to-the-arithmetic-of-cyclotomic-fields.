# An-expository-project-on-topics-related-to-the-arithmetic-of-cyclotomic-fields.
This project, An Expository Project on Topics Related to the Arithmetic of Cyclotomic Fields, formed my 4th-year undergraduate dissertation in algebraic number theory. It explores two main topics:

1. A proof of a special case of Fermat’s Last Theorem.

2. The finiteness of cyclotomic fields of class number one.

The work draws heavily on the graduate textbook Cyclotomic Fields by Lawrence Washington and requires background from the Algebraic Number Theory unit. Much of the research and exposition was carried out independently, with an emphasis on presenting the material in a coherent and accessible way.

I began the project by independently selecting an advanced theorem from Washington’s text, well beyond the typical undergraduate scope. Although the theorem’s proof required a highly technical and extensive buildup, pursuing it greatly expanded my understanding of cyclotomic fields. Ultimately, I refocused the project on proving a more targeted but substantial result, allowing for a clearer and more engaging exposition while retaining the depth gained from the initial research.
